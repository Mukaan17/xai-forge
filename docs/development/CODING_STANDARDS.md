# Coding Standards

This document outlines the coding standards and best practices for the XAI-Forge project.

## Java Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods small and focused (max 20 lines)
- Use proper indentation (4 spaces, no tabs)
- Add comprehensive JavaDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Organization
- One class per file
- Package structure: `com.example.xaiapp.{layer}.{feature}`
- Use appropriate access modifiers (private, protected, public)
- Group related functionality together

### Exception Handling
- Use specific exception types
- Always log exceptions with context
- Don't swallow exceptions silently
- Use try-with-resources for resource management

### Spring Framework
- Use constructor injection over field injection
- Prefer `@RequiredArgsConstructor` from Lombok
- Use `@Transactional` appropriately
- Follow Spring Boot best practices

## React/JavaScript Coding Standards

### General Principles
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Add PropTypes or TypeScript for type safety

### Component Structure
- One component per file
- Use default exports for main component
- Group related components in folders
- Use custom hooks for shared logic

### State Management
- Use React Context for global state
- Keep local state close to where it's used
- Use useReducer for complex state logic
- Avoid prop drilling

## Testing Standards

### Unit Tests
- Test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows
- Use test containers for database tests
- Test error scenarios
- Verify side effects

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments
- Explain why, not what
- Update comments when code changes
- Use JavaDoc for public APIs
- Add TODO comments for known issues

### README Files
- Keep README files up to date
- Include setup and usage instructions
- Add examples and code snippets
- Document any prerequisites

## Security Standards

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Sanitize data before processing
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use JWT tokens appropriately
- Implement proper session management
- Validate permissions on every request
- Log security events

## Performance Standards

### Database
- Use appropriate indexes
- Avoid N+1 queries
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper caching

### File Operations
- Use streaming for large files
- Implement proper cleanup
- Handle concurrent access
- Monitor resource usage
