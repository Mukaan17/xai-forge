# ADR-002: JWT vs Session-based Authentication

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The XAI-Forge application requires secure user authentication and authorization. The application needs to support multiple concurrent users, scale horizontally, and provide stateless authentication suitable for REST APIs. The choice between JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and session-based authentication significantly impacts the application architecture.

## Decision
We will use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication in the XAI-Forge application.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage required
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling without session replication
- **Performance**: Reduced server memory usage
- **Cross-domain**: Works across different domains and services
- **Mobile-friendly**: Suitable for mobile applications
- **Microservices**: Compatible with microservices architecture
- **Security**: Tokens can be signed and encrypted
- **Flexibility**: Can contain custom claims and metadata

### Negative Consequences
- **Token size**: JWT tokens are larger than session IDs
- **Revocation**: Difficult to revoke tokens before expiration
- **Security**: Tokens are visible to clients (though signed)
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple session management
- **Storage**: Client must store tokens securely

### Risks
- **Token theft**: If compromised, tokens are valid until expiration
- **Key management**: Secret key security is critical
- **Token size**: Large tokens increase request size
- **Client storage**: Secure token storage on client side

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Session-based Authentication
- **Pros**: Simple implementation, easy revocation, server control
- **Cons**: Server-side storage, scaling issues, stateful
- **Decision**: Rejected due to scalability concerns

### 2. OAuth 2.0
- **Pros**: Industry standard, third-party integration
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, overkill for single application
- **Decision**: Rejected as too complex for the application's needs

### 3. API Keys
- **Pros**: Simple, stateless
- **Cons**: No expiration, difficult to revoke, less secure
- **Decision**: Rejected due to security concerns

## Implementation Notes
- JWT tokens expire after 24 hours (configurable)
- Tokens are signed using HS512 algorithm
- Secret key is stored in application properties
- Tokens include user ID and username claims
- CORS is configured to allow frontend requests
- Token validation is performed on every request

## Security Considerations
- Secret key is stored securely and rotated regularly
- HTTPS is enforced in production
- Tokens are validated on every request
- User context is extracted from token claims
- Authorization is checked for resource access
