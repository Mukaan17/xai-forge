# ADR-004: Excel Reporting for Test Results

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The XAI-Forge application requires comprehensive testing with detailed reporting. Traditional test coverage dashboards (like JaCoCo HTML reports) are not suitable for enterprise environments that need structured, shareable reports. The application needs to generate test reports in a format that can be easily shared, analyzed, and integrated with enterprise reporting systems.

## Decision
We will implement **Excel-based test reporting** using Apache POI to generate structured test reports and coverage data.

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Enterprise compatibility**: Excel files are universally supported
- **Structured data**: Easy to analyze and process programmatically
- **Shareable**: Can be easily shared with stakeholders
- **Customizable**: Can include custom metrics and analysis
- **Integration**: Easy to integrate with enterprise reporting tools
- **Portability**: Works across different platforms and systems
- **Professional**: Suitable for enterprise documentation
- **Automation**: Can be generated automatically in CI/CD pipelines

### Negative Consequences
- **Dependency**: Additional dependency on Apache POI
- **File size**: Excel files can be larger than HTML reports
- **Complexity**: More complex than simple HTML reports
- **Performance**: Generating Excel files takes more time
- **Maintenance**: Need to maintain custom reporting logic

### Risks
- **POI version compatibility**: Apache POI version updates may break compatibility
- **Memory usage**: Large Excel files consume significant memory
- **File corruption**: Excel files can become corrupted
- **Performance**: Generating reports may slow down test execution

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. HTML Reports (JaCoCo)
- **Pros**: Standard format, easy to generate, web-viewable
- **Cons**: Not suitable for enterprise sharing, limited customization
- **Decision**: Rejected due to enterprise requirements

### 2. JSON Reports
- **Pros**: Machine-readable, easy to process
- **Cons**: Not human-readable, requires additional tools
- **Decision**: Rejected due to user experience concerns

### 3. PDF Reports
- **Pros**: Professional format, good for documentation
- **Cons**: Complex generation, limited programmatic access
- **Decision**: Rejected due to complexity

### 4. CSV Reports
- **Pros**: Simple format, easy to process
- **Cons**: Limited formatting, poor for complex data
- **Decision**: Rejected due to formatting limitations

## Implementation Notes
- Apache POI library for Excel generation
- Custom test listeners to capture test results
- JaCoCo XML parsing for coverage data
- Timestamped report files
- Separate sheets for different report types
- Automated report generation in CI/CD

## Report Structure
- **Test Results Sheet**: Test name, status, duration, error messages
- **Coverage Sheet**: Class name, method coverage, line coverage, branch coverage
- **Summary Sheet**: Overall statistics and metrics
- **Trends Sheet**: Historical data and trends

## Configuration
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.poi</groupId>
    <artifactId>poi-ooxml</artifactId>
    <version>5.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

## Automation
- Reports generated automatically after test execution
- Timestamped filenames for version control
- Integration with Maven Surefire plugin
- Custom test listeners for data collection
