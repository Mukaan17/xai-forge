# Monitoring Guide

This document outlines the monitoring strategy for the XAI-Forge application.

## Application Monitoring

### Health Checks
- **Endpoint**: `/actuator/health`
- **Components**: Database, file system, ML services
- **Response**: JSON with component status

### Metrics Collection
- **Endpoint**: `/actuator/metrics`
- **Metrics**: JVM, database, custom business metrics
- **Format**: Prometheus-compatible

### Key Metrics to Monitor

#### System Metrics
- CPU usage
- Memory usage (heap, non-heap)
- Disk space
- Network I/O

#### Application Metrics
- Request rate and response time
- Error rate by endpoint
- Active user sessions
- Database connection pool usage

#### Business Metrics
- Dataset uploads per hour
- Model training success rate
- Prediction requests per minute
- User registration rate

## Database Monitoring

### Connection Monitoring
- Active connections
- Connection pool utilization
- Connection wait time
- Connection errors

### Query Performance
- Slow query identification
- Query execution time
- Database locks
- Deadlock detection

### Storage Monitoring
- Database size growth
- Table size monitoring
- Index usage
- Vacuum and analyze operations

## File System Monitoring

### Upload Directory
- Total size
- File count
- Oldest files
- Disk space usage

### Model Files
- Model file sizes
- Storage utilization
- Cleanup effectiveness
- Access patterns

## ML Service Monitoring

### Model Training
- Training duration
- Success/failure rate
- Resource usage during training
- Queue length for training jobs

### Predictions
- Prediction latency
- Throughput
- Error rate
- Model performance metrics

## Logging Strategy

### Log Levels
- **ERROR**: System errors, exceptions
- **WARN**: Potential issues, deprecated usage
- **INFO**: Important business events
- **DEBUG**: Detailed debugging information

### Structured Logging
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-01-04T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "com.example.xaiapp.service.ModelService",
  "message": "Model training completed",
  "userId": 123,
  "modelId": 456,
  "duration": 15000,
  "datasetSize": 1000
}
```

### Log Aggregation
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Log rotation and retention
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Alert on error patterns

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts
- Application down
- Database connection failure
- Disk space > 90%
- High error rate (> 5%)

### Warning Alerts
- High memory usage (> 80%)
- Slow response times (> 5s)
- Database connection pool > 80%
- Unusual traffic patterns

### Business Alerts
- Training failure rate > 10%
- Prediction error rate > 5%
- User registration anomalies
- File upload failures

## Performance Monitoring

### Response Time Monitoring
- API endpoint response times
- Database query performance
- File upload/download times
- ML model inference time

### Throughput Monitoring
- Requests per second
- Concurrent users
- Database transactions per second
- File operations per minute

### Resource Utilization
- CPU usage patterns
- Memory allocation and GC
- Database I/O
- Network bandwidth

## Security Monitoring

### Authentication Events
- Login attempts (success/failure)
- Token validation failures
- Session timeouts
- Password reset requests

### Authorization Events
- Access denied events
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Resource access patterns
- Suspicious activity

### Data Access
- Dataset access patterns
- Model access logs
- File download activities
- Cross-user data access attempts

## Monitoring Tools

### Application Monitoring
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Micrometer for metrics
- Custom health indicators
- JMX monitoring

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- System resource monitoring
- Database monitoring tools
- Network monitoring
- Log aggregation tools

### Custom Dashboards
- Business metrics dashboard
- Technical metrics dashboard
- Error tracking dashboard
- Performance dashboard

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Data Collection
- Collect relevant metrics only
- Use appropriate sampling rates
- Implement data retention policies
- Ensure data privacy compliance

### Alert Management
- Set appropriate thresholds
- Avoid alert fatigue
- Implement escalation procedures
- Regular alert review

### Performance Impact
- Minimize monitoring overhead
- Use asynchronous logging
- Optimize metric collection
- Monitor the monitoring system

## Troubleshooting with Monitoring

### Performance Issues
- Identify bottlenecks using metrics
- Analyze response time patterns
- Check resource utilization
- Review database performance

### Error Investigation
- Use logs to trace error paths
- Analyze error patterns
- Check system health at error time
- Correlate errors with system events

### Capacity Planning
- Analyze growth trends
- Plan for peak usage
- Identify scaling needs
- Optimize resource allocation
