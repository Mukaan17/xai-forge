- Use UTF-8 encoding

### What's the maximum file size?

The maximum file size is **10MB**. This limit ensures:
- Fast processing and upload times
- Reasonable memory usage
- Good user experience

### How should I prepare my CSV data?

**Best Practices:**
- Include a header row with descriptive column names
- Remove or handle missing values
- Ensure consistent data types in each column
- Use meaningful column names (avoid spaces, special characters)
- Save with UTF-8 encoding

**Example CSV format:**
```csv
age,tenure,monthly_bill,churn
25,12,45.50,False
30,24,67.25,True
45,6,89.00,False
```

### Can I upload multiple datasets?

Yes! You can upload multiple datasets and use them to train different models. Each dataset is stored separately and can be managed independently.

### How do I delete a dataset?

From your dashboard:
1. Go to "My Datasets" section
2. Find the dataset you want to delete
3. Click the "Delete" button
4. Confirm the deletion

**Note**: Deleting a dataset will also delete any models trained on that dataset.

## Model Training

### What types of models are supported?

XAI-Forge currently supports:
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression (predicting categories)
- **Regression**: Linear SGD (predicting continuous values)

### How do I choose between classification and regression?

**Use Classification when:**
- Your target variable has discrete categories (e.g., Yes/No, High/Medium/Low)
- You want to predict which category something belongs to
- Examples: churn prediction, spam detection, customer segmentation

**Use Regression when:**
- Your target variable is continuous (e.g., prices, scores, quantities)
- You want to predict a numerical value
- Examples: sales forecasting, price prediction, performance scores

### How much data do I need for training?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- At least 100 rows for basic training
- More data generally leads to better models
- For classification: balanced classes work best

**Recommended:**
- 1000+ rows for reliable models
- 10+ rows per feature (avoid overfitting)
- Balanced datasets for classification problems

### What features should I select?

**Choose features that:**
- Are logically related to your target variable
- Don't have too many missing values
- Are not highly correlated with each other
- Make business sense for your problem

**Avoid:**
- Features with too many missing values
- Highly correlated features
- Features that don't relate to your target
- Too many features relative to your data size

### How long does training take?

Training time depends on:
- **Data size**: More rows = longer training
- **Number of features**: More features = longer training
- **Model complexity**: Some algorithms are faster than others

**Typical times:**
- Small datasets (< 1000 rows): 5-30 seconds
- Medium datasets (1000-10000 rows): 30 seconds - 2 minutes
- Large datasets (> 10000 rows): 2-10 minutes

### What if training fails?

**Common causes and solutions:**
- **Insufficient data**: Add more rows or reduce features
- **Missing values**: Clean your data first
- **Invalid target variable**: Check target variable values
- **Memory issues**: Reduce dataset size or features

## Predictions & Explanations

### How do I make a prediction?

1. Go to "My Models" section
2. Click "Predict" next to your trained model
3. Fill in the input fields with your test data
4. Click "Explain Prediction"
5. View the prediction and explanation chart

### What does the confidence score mean?

The confidence score indicates how certain the model is about its prediction:
- **High confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Model is very sure
- **Medium confidence (0.5-0.8)**: Model is moderately sure
- **Low confidence (0.0-0.5)**: Model is uncertain

### How do I interpret the explanation chart?

**Bar Chart Elements:**
- **X-axis**: Feature names
- **Y-axis**: Impact score (positive or negative)
- **Green bars**: Features that increase the prediction
- **Red bars**: Features that decrease the prediction
- **Bar length**: Strength of the feature's influence

**Example:**
```
Feature: "tenure"
Impact: +0.65 (Green bar)
Meaning: Higher tenure increases the likelihood of the predicted outcome
```

### What is LIME?

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)** is the technique XAI-Forge uses to generate explanations. It:
- Works with any machine learning model
- Provides explanations for individual predictions
- Shows which features were most important
- Indicates the direction of each feature's impact

### Why are explanations important?

**Explanations help you:**
- **Trust the model**: Understand why it made a decision
- **Validate results**: Check if the reasoning makes sense
- **Identify bias**: Spot unfair or incorrect patterns
- **Improve models**: Understand what the model learned
- **Comply with regulations**: Meet explainability requirements

### Can I get explanations for multiple predictions?

Yes! You can make multiple predictions and compare their explanations to understand:
- How different inputs affect the model
- Which features are consistently important
- Whether the model's reasoning is consistent
