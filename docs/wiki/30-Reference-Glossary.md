## I

**Isolation Level**
A database property that controls the visibility of changes made by one transaction to other transactions. XAI-Forge uses different isolation levels for different operations.

**Integration Test**
A type of testing that verifies the interaction between different components. XAI-Forge includes integration tests for API endpoints.

---

## J

**JPA (Java Persistence API)**
A Java specification for managing relational data. Used in XAI-Forge for database operations.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)**
A compact, URL-safe token used for authentication. XAI-Forge uses JWT for stateless authentication.

**JaCoCo**
A code coverage library for Java. Used in XAI-Forge for measuring test coverage.

---

## L

**LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**
An algorithm for explaining individual predictions of machine learning models. Used in XAI-Forge for generating explanations.

**Logistic Regression**
A statistical method for analyzing datasets with categorical dependent variables. One of the ML algorithms supported by XAI-Forge.

---

## M

**Machine Learning (ML)**
A subset of AI that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data. XAI-Forge supports classification and regression ML tasks.

**Material-UI (MUI)**
A React component library that implements Google's Material Design. Used in XAI-Forge for the user interface.

**Maven**
A build automation tool for Java projects. Used in XAI-Forge for dependency management and building.

**Model**
A mathematical representation of a real-world process. XAI-Forge trains and stores ML models for predictions.
