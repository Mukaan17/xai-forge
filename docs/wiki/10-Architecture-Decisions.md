## Overview

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document important architectural decisions made during the development of XAI-Forge. Each ADR captures the context, decision, and consequences of key technical choices.

### Purpose of ADRs

- **Documentation**: Record important architectural decisions
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain the reasoning behind decisions
- **Team Communication**: Share decision rationale across the team
- **Future Reference**: Help future developers understand past decisions
- **Decision Tracking**: Track the evolution of architectural choices

## ADR Process

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial decision proposal
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
3. **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a newer ADR
4. **Deprecated**: Decision no longer recommended
5. **Rejected**: Decision not implemented

### ADR Template

Each ADR follows a consistent structure:
- **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
- **Status**: Current status of the decision
- **Context**: Background and problem statement
- **Decision**: The architectural decision made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

## Decision Summary

### Core Technology Decisions

#### ADR-001: Tribuo ML Library
**Decision**: Use Oracle's Tribuo library for machine learning operations
**Rationale**: 
- Native Java integration
- Production-ready algorithms
- Active Oracle support
- Comprehensive ML capabilities

#### ADR-002: JWT Authentication
**Decision**: Implement JWT-based stateless authentication
**Rationale**:
- Scalable across multiple servers
- No server-side session storage
- Industry standard for REST APIs
- Mobile-friendly

#### ADR-003: Async Model Training
**Decision**: Use asynchronous processing for ML operations
**Rationale**:
- Non-blocking user experience
- Better resource utilization
- Scalable concurrent processing
- Improved system responsiveness

### Quality Assurance Decisions

#### ADR-004: Excel Test Reporting
**Decision**: Generate Excel reports for test results and coverage
**Rationale**:
- Professional reporting format
- Easy sharing with stakeholders
- Comprehensive test metrics
- Visual representation of results

#### ADR-005: Transaction Isolation
**Decision**: Implement proper transaction isolation levels
**Rationale**:
- Data consistency and integrity
- Concurrent access safety
- Proper rollback handling
- ACID compliance

### Design Pattern Decisions

#### ADR-006: Design Patterns
**Decision**: Implement Builder, Factory, and Strategy patterns
**Rationale**:
- Code maintainability and extensibility
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy algorithm addition
- Consistent object creation

## Impact Analysis

### Positive Consequences

1. **Scalability**: JWT authentication and async processing enable horizontal scaling
2. **Maintainability**: Design patterns and proper architecture improve code quality
3. **Reliability**: Transaction management and comprehensive testing ensure system stability
4. **Performance**: Async processing and connection pooling optimize resource usage
5. **Documentation**: ADRs provide clear decision rationale for future reference

### Trade-offs Considered

1. **Complexity vs. Flexibility**: More complex patterns provide greater flexibility
2. **Performance vs. Consistency**: Transaction isolation may impact performance
3. **Development Time vs. Quality**: Additional patterns require more development time
4. **Learning Curve vs. Maintainability**: New patterns require team learning

## Future Considerations

### Potential ADRs

1. **Microservices Migration**: Consider breaking monolith into microservices
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Architecture decisions for cloud deployment
3. **Advanced XAI Techniques**: Integration of SHAP, Integrated Gradients
4. **Real-time Processing**: Streaming data processing capabilities
5. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations

### Review Process

- **Quarterly Review**: Review all ADRs quarterly for relevance
- **Decision Updates**: Update ADRs when decisions change
- **New ADRs**: Create new ADRs for significant architectural changes
- **Deprecation**: Mark outdated ADRs as deprecated
